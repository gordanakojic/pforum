Routes
======

Currently, we don't have any route configuration here.
There is no slug field in frontend forms for topics and posts. So, there is no
valid possibility to create human-readable URLs. Maybe we can add a slug field to the forum records as these kind
of records will be created in backend.

Please profile an issue ticket for that, if you're interessted.
