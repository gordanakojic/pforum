Pforum Administration Module
============================

`pforum` comes with its own administration module.
Here an administrator or an editor with given rights can activate hidden topic and post records.

If `settings.topic.hideAtCreation` and `settings.post.hideAtCreation` are deactivated in TypoScript you can deactivate
that module for editors as it is useless in that case.
